The company needs to predict the solvency of invoices issued to customers to which it supplies electricity and gas. An overdue invoice with a balance negative indicates 
the customer's arrears. This forecast is necessary for organizing future credit department activities.

The goal is to build a predictive model that supports the company.

The data sources will be two: the first comes from CERVED and describes client company status with the relative information on its solvency; the second set of data comes 
from the company and represents the list of invoices issued in the years 2021 and 2022 for each customer in question.
